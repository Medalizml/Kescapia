# Kescapia

**Secure Digital Asset Explorer & Encryption MVP**

Kescapia is an innovative project that redefines digital asset ownership and access by binding file encryption directly to wallet ownership. This repository focuses on the MVP phase, where we develop a custom file format and a decryption shell/application. The vision is to create a unique, secure digital asset ecosystem that paves the way for a future explorer-style interface.

## Overview

In a digital world full of easily copied assets, Kescapia introduces a unique file extension `.kesc` that not only proves ownership but also restricts access exclusively to the owner's wallet. By encrypting assets and tying decryption to wallet credentials, Kescapia ensures that each asset remains secure and truly unique.

## Features

- **Custom File Format:**  
  A unique file extension that signifies a secure, ownership-bound digital asset.

- **Hybrid Encryption:**  
  Combines symmetric encryption (for file content) and asymmetric encryption (for the encryption key), ensuring that only the wallet owner can decrypt the file.

- **Wallet Integration:**  
  Binds file decryption directly to wallet ownership using established cryptographic methods (e.g., ECIES).

- **Decryption Shell/Application:**  
  A user-friendly interface to decrypt and access the secure file content with the owner's credentials.

## Architecture

### Custom File Format

- **Header:**  
  Contains metadata such as version info, owner wallet ID, and an embedded encrypted symmetric key.

- **Content:**  
  The actual digital asset encrypted using a robust symmetric algorithm (e.g., AES).

### Encryption & Decryption Process

1. **Encryption Process:**
   - Generate a random symmetric key.
   - Encrypt the file content with the symmetric key.
   - Encrypt the symmetric key using the owner's wallet public key.
   - Package the encrypted key and file content into the custom file format.

2. **Decryption Process:**
   - Extract metadata and the encrypted symmetric key from the file header.
   - Decrypt the symmetric key using the wallet ownerâ€™s private key.
   - Decrypt the file content using the decrypted symmetric key.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Your preferred development environment (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.)
- A modern code editor

*Further setup instructions will be detailed as the project evolves.*

### Installation

## Backlog

## Roadmap

1. **Phase One (MVP):**

- Define project scope and requirements.
- Research and select technologies for encryption and wallet integration.
- Develop the custom file format and encryption module.
- Build a decryption shell/application for wallet-based access.

2. **Future Phases:**

- Integrate smart contracts for dynamic access control.
- Develop a full-fledged explorer interface (akin to Windows Explorer or macOS Finder).
- Enhance security, scalability, and user experience.
